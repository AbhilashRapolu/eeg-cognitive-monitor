# Product Roadmap: Phases & Long-Term Vision

**Status:** Real-time prototype validated on Muse 2 (10 sessions, 4,087 trials)

---

## Product Phases

**Phase A (Research Validation):** Multi-user validation + performance grounding. Recruit diverse users, recalibrate state thresholds to lab targets (60–75% Optimal). Ground 3-axis metrics (Arousal/Control/Executive) in real task performance using N-back, Stroop, coding tasks. Prove Arousal/Control deltas predict error rate & speed. Gate: Thresholds validated cross-user, R² ≥0.45 for Arousal↔performance.

**Phase B (Custom Hardware + Production):** Build custom EEG headset (4 channels, better SNR than Muse 2) + production software stack (cloud backend, iOS/Android app, research dashboard, public API). Gate: Hardware passes SNR benchmarks, cloud system ≥99.9% uptime.

**Phase C (Platform Launch):** Go-to-market across multiple segments. Consumer app (freemium model: basic monitoring, advanced insights). Enterprise API for research teams & HR departments. PoCW beta with 2–3 education partners. Cognitive data market experiments (users opt-in to earn from brain traces). Gate: 500+ app downloads, 10+ enterprise pilots, revenue traction.

## Long-Term Vision: 3 Core Platforms

**1. Proof-of-Cognitive-Work (PoCW) + Authentic Human Content**
- Cryptographically prove humans (not LLMs) created content via EEG signatures + behavioral data
- Use cases: verify freelance deliverables, authenticate art/music/code, preserve "human-made" premium in AI-saturated world
- Revenue: $0.50–$2.00 per proof; 100M+ proofs/year = $50–200M ARR by 2030

**2. Cognitive Data Market + Universal Income from Thinking**
- Users opt-in to share anonymized EEG traces during learning/work; AI labs buy data to train reasoning models
- Use cases: Students earn $50–200/mo while studying; knowledge workers earn $100–500/mo passively; developing nations (India, SE Asia) earn 30–50% of median wage from home
- Revenue: Platform takes 30% of $7–20B annual payouts at scale = $2–6B ARR

**3. Frictionless Meritocracy: Career Shifting + Fair Hiring**
- Skip degrees/bootcamps. Prove cognitive capability via real-time problem-solving + EEG verification
- Use cases: Anyone can switch careers in weeks (not years); employers hire pure on verified capability, blind to background; eliminates credential inflation + demographic bias
- Revenue: Certification fees, employer subscriptions, skill marketplace integrations = $50–200M ARR

## Path Forward

**Immediate (Phase A):** Multi-user research validation + performance grounding  
**Medium-term (Phase B):** Custom hardware + production platform  
**Long-term (Phase C):** PoCW, data markets, fair hiring ecosystem
